1. Introduction & Setup
Welcome to our web development project! In this initiative, we will build a fully functional web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout this process, we’ll integrate version control, collaborative tools, and structured planning to ensure a smooth development experience.

Key Aspects of the Project
Technology Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Version Control: Git & GitHub for collaboration

Roles & Responsibilities:

Figma Designers: Create wireframes and UI/UX design

Developers: Implement frontend and interactive features

Documentation & Testing: Maintain project documentation and test functionality

2. Persona & Client Brief
Each team will either be assigned or choose a persona that represents the target user. This will guide all design and development decisions.

Persona Profile Includes
Background (26 years old avid gamer passionate about competetive play, game review, and community)

App Idea (A social app that connects games, offers tournament organization,game news, and community)

Design Suggestions (color black,neongreen, and  electric Blue , fonts, visual preferences)

Target Audience (age group, demographics, user needs)

Vision :We envision a premier online destination for Tetris and Tekken tournaments, recognized for its user-friendly interface, competitive integrity, and passionate community. Our goal is to expand and evolve, becoming the go-to platform for structured and high-quality esports competitions in these iconic games.

Mission:We envision a premier online destination for Tetris and Tekken tournaments, recognized for its user-friendly interface, competitive integrity, and passionate community. Our goal is to expand and evolve, becoming the go-to platform for structured and high-quality esports competitions in these iconic games.

Offerings (Tournament scheduling game,news ,live streaming intergration,community chat)

3. Project Planning
To ensure efficient collaboration, teams will:
✅ Form groups and assign responsibilities.
✅ Outline the initial project requirements based on the persona’s prompt.
✅ Develop a timeline with key milestones.

Project Milestones
Milestone	Task	Deadline
Week 1	Initial Planning & Wireframes
Week 2	HTML & CSS Development	
Week 3	JavaScript & Interactivity	
Week 4	Testing & Final Adjustments	


4. Team Collaboration Tools
We will be using industry-standard tools to streamline our workflow:

 GitHub (Version Control)
Purpose: Allows collaborative coding, version tracking, and issue management.

Setup: Teams will create a repository and manage branches efficiently.

 Figma (UI/UX Design)
Purpose: Wireframing, prototyping, and visual design.

Usage: Designers will use Figma to create mockups and share design components.

 Documentation & Testing
Teams will maintain a README.md file with project details.

Week 2 Activities.

1. HTML & CSS Fundamentals Review
 Quick recap of HTML structure and CSS styling.
 Best practices for responsive design.

2. Wireframing & Prototyping
 Figma Designers present initial wireframes based on the persona.


Layout & structure

Navigation flow

Visual hierarchy

3. Development Kickoff
 Developers start setting up the project using semantic HTML.
 Apply initial CSS styles (or a CSS framework) based on the Figma design.

4. Documentation & Testing Plan
 Documentation team drafts:

Project guide

Testing criteria & usability checkpoints

2-Hour Demo Session
 Live Coding Session:
 Build a basic HTML scaffold.
 Apply initial CSS styles.
 Demonstrate translating Figma designs → HTML/CSS.
 Tips for responsive design & setting up a grid layout.

Takeaway
By the end of Week 2, each group should have:
 A working static web page
 A layout reflecting their persona’s requirements.

Week 3: Core Development & Design Refinement

1. Enhancing the UI
CSS Refinement:

Refined CSS to match the persona's color scheme (black, neon green, and electric blue).

Chose these colors based on the feedback from the instructor, aligning with the features being added, such as tournament scheduling, game news, and community chat.

Advanced CSS techniques like transitions, animations, flexbox, and grid layout were incorporated to improve user experience and design consistency.

2. Interactive Elements
JavaScript Integration:

Introduced JavaScript to enhance interactivity:

Navigation Menus: Added dynamic navigation menus with hover effects.

Modals: Implemented modals for tournament details, news updates, and player profiles.

Form Validations: JavaScript was used to validate forms for user registration, tournament sign-ups, and chat inputs.

New Features:

Dynamic Content Updates: Real-time updates through JavaScript for displaying tournament schedules, player stats, and chat messages.

User Authentication: Integrated user login and registration systems for personalized experiences.

Game News Feed: Dynamically fetches game news from an external API and displays it in a carousel or news section.

3. Role-Specific Tasks
Figma Designers:

Updated and finalized high-fidelity designs based on feedback from the previous weeks.

Ensured designs were aligned with the color scheme and features.

Developers:

Implemented interactive JavaScript components like modals, navigation menus, and form validation.

Integrated new JavaScript features for dynamic content and real-time updates.

Documentation & Testing Teams:

Updated the project documentation to include details about the new JavaScript features and interactivity.

Prepared initial test cases, focusing on functional and UI testing of new features, such as modals, forms, and dynamic content updates.

4. Peer Review & Feedback
Group Reviews:

Each group shared their progress, ensuring that design consistency and usability were maintained.

Collected peer feedback on the newly implemented JavaScript features and design elements.

5. 2-Hour Demo Session
Live Demonstration:

Walkthrough of refining CSS styles and integrating JavaScript for interactivity.

Demonstrated how the new features (modals, navigation menus, real-time updates) were implemented and tested.

Shared debugging techniques for common issues with JavaScript interactivity and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Best Practices:

Emphasized maintaining design consistency throughout the application.

Discussed the importance of responsiveness in the new features to ensure accessibility across devices.

Takeaway
By the end of Week 3, students should have:

A core version of the web application with refined design elements and new interactive JavaScript features.

Implemented dynamic content features such as game news feeds, real-time updates, and user authentication.

Completed peer reviews to ensure design consistency and usability.
